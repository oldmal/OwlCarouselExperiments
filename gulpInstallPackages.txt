or 

npm init

I copy the devDependencies bit from the package.json of one of my previous projects into 
my newly created package.json, then I run 

npm i 

which installs all dependencies listed in package.json. 
It's a huge timesaver, especially since I usually copy my gulpfile.js as well.

Note: don't forget to run 

npm outdated

if it's been a while since your previous project started, 
to check if any of the dependencies have been updated in the meantime.
